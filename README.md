# croco_pytools

This is a python redesign of the matlab pre- and post-processing tools for CROCO (croco_tools) developed over the last 20 years.

It's a work in progress, which needs to be improved and further tested for some of its features.

For the moment, it's a related project, not officially included in CROCO. It is distributed on a separate GIT repository (XXXX).

A moyen terme, ces outils python seront inclus dans les release officiels du projet croco

To checkout this tools:

  - ***croco_pyvisu***: a vizualisation GUI
  - ***xcroco***: for analysis based on xarray and xgcm

#
### PREPRO
See README.INSTALL for installation of the required python environement (using conda) and compilation of python librairies interfaced with fortran
