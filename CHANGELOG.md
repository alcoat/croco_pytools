## [1.0.3] - 2025-03-21

### Added

### Fixed

- Fix nesting with AGRIF: child grid corners indices are now correctly written in
  the croco_grd file and AGRIF_FixedGrids.in (Issue #20 and #18)
- Fix in prepro/make_tides: some numpy meshgrid was lost at a previous commit, correct
  to have make_tides work again (Issue #31)

  (Issue #19 and #24)

- Fix output filenames in case of more than one nest
- Move files generated by make_zoom_ibc in the good directory

- Fix zeta and z levels in case of wet-dry (Issue #39)
