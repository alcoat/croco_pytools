In here we have one make_ini.py. The aim is to have only one script for
all kind of dataset. In the current state the script can handle:
	- mercator (glorys)
	- soda
	- eccov4  (V4.3)

To add a new dataset you just have to go in Modules/dico.py and
create a dico with correspondance between croco_var(ssh,u,v,temp,salt)
and dataset variable names.

The periodicity of a dataset (if it is -180/180 or 0/360) is handle by the
script. Just download the dataset on it should be fine

The script works as follow:
	- reads croco_grd
	- reads input data and restricts the area of spatial coverage
	- creates croco_ini.nc
	- computes coefficients for horizontal interpolation on each grid (rho,u,v)
	- Loop on var with:
		* horizontal interpolation
		* vertical interpolation
	- Writes data in netcdf
